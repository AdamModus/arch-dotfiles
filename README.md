dotfiles and steps used to configure Arch with yay the way I like.

# yay packages I like to install
- 1password: manage my passwords and logins
- alacritty: a cool terminal that uses native GPU rendering
- betterbird-bin: betterbird is a cool version of Thunderbird from Mozilla to manage emails and calendar stuff
- btop: system monitor in the command line
- chromium: browser
- cmatrix-git: the Matrixâ„¢ on your command line, because it's fun.
- discord: talking with some friends and some communities
- dolphin: favourite Linux file manager
- fastfetch: rust-based neofetch
- firefox: browser
- fish: my favourite shell
- fisher: fish-specific package manager
- fnm: Fast and simple Node.js version manager, built in Rust

- qbittorrent: Favourite torrent client, to download my Linux distro ISOs.
- slack-desktop: Official Slack client for Linux

- steam: Official Steam Client for Linux ( will need to enable [multilib](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Official_repositories#multilib) to install it)
- thefuck: An amazing console app that can fix previous console commands.
- vim: One day I'll learn this and feel super snobby about it. Until then, I'll only ever remember how to exit it... sometimes.
- vlc: Best video player I've been using since... 2005?
- zapzap: Favourite WhatsApp client on Linux (though installing a PWA is the only official client)
- zed: While I'm still not maining this, I want to. It's a very nice, very fast IDE.
- zen-browser-bin: Zen is my favourite browser to use for personal stuff
- zoxide: A fast directory jumper
